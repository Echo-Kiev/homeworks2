Probably a thirteenth-century borrowing from Old Provençal espaignol (compare modern Occitan espanhòl, Catalan espanyol, French espagnol), from Vulgar Latin *Hispaniolus ‎(“of Spain”)[1], from Latin Hispānus, from Hispania. According to phonetic rules, if inherited from Latin, the Castilian Spanish result would have been *españuelo (though some argue that this did not take root because the suffix -uelo would be perceived as diminutive; more likely, it was simply because there was no need at the time for a common secular name for all the inhabitants of Christian Iberia/Spain, and a common identity as a unified people or entity had not yet been formed. Until then, the people used cristiano ‎(“Christian”) to refer to themselves) колобок.
